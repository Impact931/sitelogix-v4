# PROGRESS.md - Ralph Session Progress

This file tracks progress during Ralph autonomous coding sessions. It serves as short-term memory between iterations.

## How This File Works

After each Ralph iteration, the agent appends:
- Iteration number
- Story ID and title completed
- Files changed
- Key learnings or notes for next iteration
- Any blockers or issues encountered

This allows subsequent iterations to pick up context quickly without re-reading all code.
